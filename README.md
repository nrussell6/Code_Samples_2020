# EXP_Counter
Welcome to the EXP Counter.
This program was designed to make keeping track of a party's EXP total
easy, using a terminal.

Use Case:
- You like playing retro NES games such as Dragon Warrior, Final Fantasy, of Phantasy Star.
- However these games don't have an easy way to keep track and display how much EXP
characters in your party need before they level up.
- This program, used in the terminal, allows you to save character experience point
details for each member of the party, display them in the terminal, and reduce that count
by how much EXP was earned during battle.

NOTES REGARDING USE:
- To start open a terminal, navigate to where the exp_counter.py script is saved, and enter the
following:
  - python exp_counter.py
- Follow the on-screen prompts and enjoy!
